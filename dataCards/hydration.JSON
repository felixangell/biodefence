Without water your body is unable to pass nutrients around the body, your muscles wouldn't be able to function and your brain and heart would stop working! Some pretty serious stuff! It is recommended to drink 1 - 1.5 litres of water a day depending on the air temperature and the amount of exercise you've done! But be careful, drinking too much water can have some pretty bad consequences too",
